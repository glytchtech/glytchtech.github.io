<p> It's pretty clear that the response to Huricane Maria devestating Harvey has been...inadequate. Had there been proper political foresight, 
a disaster response plan would've been drafted up and approved in advance, and a much more adequate response carried out. </p>

<p> Rather than point fingers, I figured the best way to handle a bad idea, is propose a good idea. Not that this is likely to be heard by 
anyone who can do anything about it, but here it is anyway: Logistics is the issue, and logistics is all about efficiency...and if I know one 
thing about the government, its not known for its efficiency and swift action. When I ask you what's the first thing to come to mind when I 
say "Gets packages to where they need to go, quickly and safely" who comes to mind? USPS? Some other shipping companies? Amazon themselves even?
All of the above have a pretty decent reputation for getting things where they need to go in a matter of days, rather than weeks, no matter what
comes up. Now of course, getting planes into Puerto Rico is a bit difficult, and that's where the below plan comes in to play: </p> 


- Get initial National Guard in first with C130s. They can land pretty much anywhere. 
- Survey and chose runways and airports which can service larger civilian aircraft. Chose ones which can quickly be made servicable
- Get them operational. Clear debris, use cargo planes to fly in stair trucks, forklifts, and anything else needed to load and unload people and cargo
- Once a flight plan is in place, and you have regular supply flights coming in, and evacuation/medical flights going out:
- Refocus National Guard onto clearing roads in and around the airports, and main highways/intersections/etc. 
- Setup supply distribution off of major intersections, and use any available vehicles and volunteers to haul and dsitribute suppliesa at those points. 

<p> What this allows, is a massive air bridge. Focussing initial efforts on opening airports, means National Gaurd can then worry about flying in
heavy equipment to clear and repair roads, stabilize structures, etc, while civillian craft focus on bringing in other supplies. National Guard's
workload becomes significantly reduced, letting them focus on opening up roadways, allowing civillian vehicles to move freely. One could even 
consider hiring Amazon and/or FedEx at this point. Allow them to write off the relief effort as a tax incentive maybe, and they also get a lot of
good public relations material out of it, while their efficiency at taking orders and delivering supplies helps those in need. It very quickly
becomes a win-win situation for everyone involved, and significantly increases the rate at which things get restored to normalcy.</p> 

<p> Ideally, a plan would've been put in place and approved in advance, however given our current political climate, it's pretty clear there was very
little chance that any foresight went into effect. Ships weren't being made ready to mobilize, cargo and supplies weren't being prepared. 
Everything is an afterthought. So now its a game of making best use of available resources, and I believe this is the way it should be handled.
Spread out the workload, setup reliable, and continuous air bridges, and let people focus on what they're good at.</p>
