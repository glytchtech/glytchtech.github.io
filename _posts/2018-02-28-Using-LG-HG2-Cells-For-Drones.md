title: 'Using LG HG2 and ohter Lithium Ion Cells for Drones'
published: false

<p> I've always had an interest in using alternative battery chemistries in squeezing a bit more flight time out of drones. 
LG HG2 cells are currently the most attractive option in my opinion, rated for over 20a continuous draw and packing a massive 
3000mah, they have  sufficient current, and far higher energy density than conventional lithium polymer batteries usually used in 
drones. </p> 

<p> There is however at least two down sides that have surfaced a couple of times in my attempts at using these cells in various platforms. The first is one of voltage curve. All batteries have a voltage curve. As you use up their capacity, the voltage falls. 
Lithium polymer curves are relatively flat and consistent, meaning you have a very predictable flight profile and drop off point. 
Lithium ion on the other hand, has a steeper curve, meaning performance of the drone can change as capacity is used up. </p>

<p> The second issue is the internal resistance of cells, again, a thing all batteries have. Internal resistance, as the name implies, is the resistance in a cell. This ultimately decides how much current can be passed through/sourced from a patricular 
battery. Lithium polymers are often chosen for drones to their <b> VERY </b> low internal resistance, and thus very high current
capability and low voltage fluctuation under high loads. Meanwhile, lithium ions suffer from lower current output and bigger 
voltage fluctuations. That last part is of particular note in my latest drone related project using non standard cells, [Project Cuckoo](http://glytch.tech/Watch-Dogs-Inspired-WiFi-Pineapple-Drone/) </p>
