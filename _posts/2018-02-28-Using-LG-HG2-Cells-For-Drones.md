title: 'Using LG HG2 Cells for Drones'
published: false

<p> I've always had an interest in using alternative battery chemistries in squeezing a bit more flight time out of drones. 
LG HG2 cells are currently the most attractive option in my opinion, rated for over 20a continuous draw and packing a massive 
3000mah, they have  sufficient current, and far higher energy density than conventional lithium polymer batteries usually used in 
drones. </p>
